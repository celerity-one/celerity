# Introduction

Recastui is a UI toolkit that enables the development of accessible web applications and design systems using React(soon Solidjs, Svelte and others). It includes a collection of themeable UI components and primitives that can serve as a solid foundation for implementing design systems.

## Key features

### Accessible

Recastui adheres to the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) as much as possible. It takes care of accessibility implementation details such as ARIA attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation.

### Composable

Recastui provides fine-grained access to individual components' parts, allowing you to wrap them and add your own event listeners, props, and more.

### Themeable

Component in Recastui are shipped with themed styles using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) & variations powered by [CVA](https://cva.style) , allowing you to completely customize the look and feel.

### Automatic Dark Mode

No need to add prefix `dark:` to your classes in your code for dark mode. No conditional logic required. Recast uses [Radix-color](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) pallets along with the power of CSS custom properties to automatically create dark variants equivalent for the used color pallet. All components are built with dark mode in mind.
